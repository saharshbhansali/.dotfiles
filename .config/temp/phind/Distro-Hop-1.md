**Gpt-4 answer:**
Distro hopping from one Linux distribution to another can be done without losing much data or reinstalling programs, but it requires careful planning and execution. Here's a detailed step-by-step guideline to help you through the process:

1.  **Create a separate partition for `/home`**: Having a separate partition for your `/home` directory is crucial. This isolates your personal data from the system files and makes it easier to switch between distributions without losing data ([makeuseof.com](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/upgrade-switch-linux-distros-without-losing-files/), [maketecheasier.com](https://www.maketecheasier.com/switch-between-linux-distros-without-losing-data/)).

2.  **Backup your data**: Before starting the distro hopping process, make sure to backup all your important files and configurations to an external drive or cloud storage. This ensures that you have a copy of your data in case something goes wrong during the process ([embeddedinventor.com](https://embeddedinventor.com/distro-hopping-what-why-how-explained/), [unix.stackexchange.com](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/119172/installing-different-distro-without-losing-home)).

3.  **Make a list of installed programs**: Note down the list of installed programs on your current distribution. This will help you automate the reinstallation process on the new distribution. You can use the package manager of your current distribution to generate a list of installed packages ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/9nod5k/how_to_switch_linux_distros_without_losing_data/)).

4.  **Install the new distribution**: Download the ISO file of the new distribution you want to switch to and create a bootable USB drive. Boot from the USB drive and start the installation process. During the installation, make sure to select the existing partition for `/home` without formatting it. This will preserve your personal data and settings ([unix.stackexchange.com](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/119172/installing-different-distro-without-losing-home), [techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/the-pain-free-guide-to-switching-linux-distros-478667)).

5.  **Reinstall programs**: After the new distribution is installed, use the list of installed programs from step 3 to reinstall the programs on the new distribution. You can create a script to automate the installation process using the package manager of the new distribution ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/9nod5k/how_to_switch_linux_distros_without_losing_data/)).

6.  **Restore configurations**: If you have any custom configurations, restore them from your backups. Make sure to check for compatibility with the new distribution before applying the configurations ([embeddedinventor.com](https://embeddedinventor.com/distro-hopping-what-why-how-explained/)).

7.  **Verify and test**: After completing the above steps, verify that all your data is intact and all the programs are working as expected. Test your new distribution and make sure everything is running smoothly.

Remember that distro hopping requires a systematic approach and a clear goal in mind, so be prepared to invest time and effort into learning and understanding the new distribution ([embeddedinventor.com](https://embeddedinventor.com/distro-hopping-what-why-how-explained/)).

___
**Gpt-4 answer:**
To link your programs to their respective configuration files stored in your dotfiles, you can create a shell script that creates symbolic links for each configuration file. Here's an example script to get you started:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the path to your dotfiles directory
DOTFILES_PATH="/path/to/your/dotfiles"

# KDE
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/konsave" "$HOME/.config/konsave"

# Neovim
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/nvim" "$HOME/.config/nvim"

# Zsh
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/zsh" "$HOME/.zshrc"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/oh-my-zsh" "$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/powerlevel10k" "$HOME/.config/powerlevel10k"

# Brave extensions
# Note: You may need to adjust the paths for Brave's extension configurations.
BRAVE_EXTENSIONS_PATH="$HOME/.config/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/Default/Extensions"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/brave-extensions" "$BRAVE_EXTENSIONS_PATH"

# Other configurations
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/autostart" "$HOME/.config/autostart"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/betterlockscreenrc" "$HOME/.config/betterlockscreenrc"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/btop" "$HOME/.config/btop"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/flameshot" "$HOME/.config/flameshot"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/htop" "$HOME/.config/htop"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/i3" "$HOME/.config/i3"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/kwinrc" "$HOME/.config/kwinrc"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/libinput-gestures.conf" "$HOME/.config/libinput-gestures.conf"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/monkeytype" "$HOME/.config/monkeytype"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/neofetch" "$HOME/.config/neofetch"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/nitrogen" "$HOME/.config/nitrogen"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/notion-app-enhanced" "$HOME/.config/notion-app-enhanced"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/picom" "$HOME/.config/picom"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/polybar" "$HOME/.config/polybar"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/protonvpn" "$HOME/.config/protonvpn"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/rofi" "$HOME/.config/rofi"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/spotify-adblock" "$HOME/.config/spotify-adblock"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/touchegg" "$HOME/.config/touchegg"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/touchpadxlibinputrc" "$HOME/.config/touchpadxlibinputrc"
ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/vlc" "$HOME/.config/vlc"

# /opt tools
sudo ln -sf "$DOTFILES_PATH/opt" "/opt"
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/dotfiles` with the actual path to your dotfiles directory. Also, note that you may need to adjust the paths for Brave's extension configurations, as these paths can vary depending on your system.

After creating the script, give it execute permissions using `chmod +x script_name.sh` and run it with `./script_name.sh`. This will create the necessary symbolic links to connect each program with its configuration file.

Keep in mind that this script assumes that you have already organized your dotfiles in the same structure as the configuration files on your system. If your dotfiles are organized differently, you'll need to adjust the script accordingly.

How do I create my dotfiles so that the above script works? I am using fedora 38 Also, /opt is on the root partition, how to make sure it isn't erased...

**Gpt-3.5 answer:**
To create your dotfiles in a way that the script works, you can follow the steps below:

1.  **Create a directory for your dotfiles**: Start by creating a directory to store your dotfiles. You can name it `.dotfiles` or any other name you prefer. Place this directory in your home directory (`~`).

2.  **Organize your dotfiles**: Within the `.dotfiles` directory, organize your dotfiles in a structure that mirrors their locations in your home directory. For example, if you have a configuration file for Neovim located at `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`, create a corresponding directory structure within `.dotfiles` and place the `init.vim` file there (`~/.dotfiles/.config/nvim/init.vim`).

3.  **Use symbolic links**: Instead of copying the configuration files to their original locations, create symbolic links from the original locations to the corresponding files in your `.dotfiles` directory. This way, any changes you make to the dotfiles in the `.dotfiles` directory will be reflected in the actual configuration files.

You can use a tool like GNU Stow to manage the symbolic links. Install GNU Stow using the package manager on your Fedora system (`sudo dnf install stow`).

Once installed, navigate to your `.dotfiles` directory and run the following command to create the symbolic links:

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
   stow .
```

This will create symbolic links for all the files and directories within `.dotfiles` in their respective locations in your home directory.

4.  **Verify the symbolic links**: Run `ls -al ~` to check that the symbolic links have been created correctly. You should see the linked files and directories with an arrow pointing to their original locations in `.dotfiles`.

For example, if you have a symbolic link for Neovim's `init.vim`, you should see something like this:

```sql
lrwxrwxrwx   1 user user    26 Jun 26 10:00 .config -> /home/user/.dotfiles/.config
```

This indicates that the `.config` directory is symbolically linked to the corresponding directory in `.dotfiles`.

5.  **Exclude `/opt` from deletion**: To ensure that the `/opt` directory is not erased during the move to a new distribution, you need to make sure that it is not included in your dotfiles or the symbolic links.

The script provided earlier does not include `/opt` in the dotfiles setup, so you don't need to worry about it being erased. However, if you have any specific configurations or files within `/opt` that you want to preserve, you should back them up separately and restore them manually after the distro hopping process.

By following these steps and using GNU Stow to manage your dotfiles, you can easily create a structure that works with the script provided earlier. This allows you to easily link your programs to their configuration files stored in your dotfiles and maintain a consistent setup across distributions.
