Detailed Methodology for Bug Bounty Hunting
-------------------------------------------

Here's a step-by-step methodology that covers recon, discovery, vulnerability testing, finding a foothold, exploiting the bug, and writing a report:

1.  **Reconnaissance**: Start with passive recon to gather information about your target. Use tools like `DNS-Discovery` for subdomain enumeration and `Reverse IP Lookup` to find domains hosted on the same IP address. [resources.infosecinstitute.com](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/top-10-security-tools-for-bug-bounty-hunters/)

2.  **Discovery**: Use tools like `Wfuzz` for brute-forcing web applications, `Wapiti` for scanning websites and web applications, and `Google Dorks` for searching hidden data and access pages. Additionally, use `Burp Suite` for comprehensive scanning and testing. [resources.infosecinstitute.com](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/top-10-security-tools-for-bug-bounty-hunters/)

3.  **Vulnerability testing**: Once you've discovered potential targets, use tools like `IronWASP` to check for vulnerabilities in websites. For mobile applications, use tools like `INalyzer` for iOS platform testing. [resources.infosecinstitute.com](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/top-10-security-tools-for-bug-bounty-hunters/)

4.  **Finding a foothold**: Analyze the information gathered during the previous steps and identify potential vulnerabilities and weak points in the target's infrastructure. Prioritize vulnerabilities based on impact and likelihood of exploitation.

5.  **Exploiting the bug**: Once you've identified a vulnerability, attempt to exploit it using tools like `HackBar` for testing XSS holes and SQL injections, or `Burp Suite` for testing various attack insertion points. Always follow the rules and guidelines of the bug bounty program when exploiting vulnerabilities. [resources.infosecinstitute.com](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/top-10-security-tools-for-bug-bounty-hunters/)

6.  **Writing a report**: After successfully exploiting a bug, document your findings in a clear and concise report. Include the following information:

*   A brief summary of the vulnerability
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
*   Impact and severity of the vulnerability
*   Potential mitigations or fixes for the vulnerability

Ensure your report is well-structured and easy to understand. Submit the report to the bug bounty program following their submission guidelines.

By following this methodology and using the suggested tools, you'll be able to effectively hunt for bugs in a bug bounty program. Remember to always adhere to the rules of the program and practice responsible disclosure.

How do I use these tools and the methodology to find the following bugs: IDORs XSS CSRF Give very very deatiled steps

___
**Gpt-4 answer:**
Based on the provided sources, let's break down the detailed steps for finding the following bugs: IDORs, XSS, and CSRF.

### Finding IDORs (Insecure Direct Object References)

1.  Test for encoded and hashed IDs: Instead of simply incrementing an ID, inspect the request for encoded or hashed IDs. Decode or hash the IDs and try different combinations to discover potential IDOR vulnerabilities. [blog.intigriti.com](https://blog.intigriti.com/2019/09/24/bug-bytes-37-how-to-find-more-idors-race-condition-to-rce-tracy/)

2.  Add an ID to the request: Even if the application doesn't ask for an ID in the request, try adding one and observe the response. This may expose hidden IDOR vulnerabilities. [blog.intigriti.com](https://blog.intigriti.com/2019/09/24/bug-bytes-37-how-to-find-more-idors-race-condition-to-rce-tracy/)

3.  Change the request method: Experiment with different HTTP request methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to identify potential IDOR vulnerabilities. [blog.intigriti.com](https://blog.intigriti.com/2019/09/24/bug-bytes-37-how-to-find-more-idors-race-condition-to-rce-tracy/)

4.  Combine IDOR and self-XSS: If you find an IDOR vulnerability, check if it can be combined with a self-XSS to escalate the impact, potentially leading to stored XSS. [blog.intigriti.com](https://blog.intigriti.com/2019/09/24/bug-bytes-37-how-to-find-more-idors-race-condition-to-rce-tracy/)

### Finding XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

1.  Use automated tools: Leverage tools like [Epsylon's XSSer](https://xsser.03c8.net/), [S0md3v's XSStrike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike), or [PortSwigger's XSS-Validator Extension](https://github.com/PortSwigger/xss-validator) to scan for XSS vulnerabilities. These tools can help you identify potential injection points and provide payloads to test. [thecybersecurityman.com](https://thecybersecurityman.com/2021/02/15/a-bug-bounty-testers-guide-to-detecting-xss-vulnerabilities/)

2.  Manual testing: After using automated tools, manually verify the discovered vulnerabilities by inserting XSS payloads into the injection points. Use the [OWASP XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet](https://owasp.org/www-community/xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet) as a reference for crafting XSS payloads. [owasp.org](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)

3.  Test for DOM-based XSS: Some tools like XSStrike can also scan for DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities, which are often overlooked. [thecybersecurityman.com](https://thecybersecurityman.com/2021/02/15/a-bug-bounty-testers-guide-to-detecting-xss-vulnerabilities/)

### Finding CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

1.  Test for CSRF vulnerabilities: Follow the [OWASP Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/05-Testing_for_CSRF) to identify potential CSRF vulnerabilities in the target application. [owasp.org](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)

2.  Analyze form keys and hashes: Inspect forms for per-request nonces (form keys) or hashes that may be used for CSRF protection. Try modifying these values to bypass the protection and test for CSRF vulnerabilities. [owasp.org](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)

3.  Test referrer header checks: If the application uses referrer header checks as a CSRF prevention mechanism, attempt to bypass these checks using XSS vulnerabilities. For example, the Samy worm used XMLHttpRequest to obtain the CSRF token and forge requests. [owasp.org](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)

By following these detailed steps and using the mentioned tools, you can effectively hunt for IDOR, XSS, and CSRF vulnerabilities in bug bounty programs.

**You:**
Teach me methods that use manual testing rather than automated testing tools I would like to learn as I go along discovering bugs

___
**Gpt-4 answer:**
Here are some manual testing methods for finding bugs in web applications, focusing on IDORs, XSS, and CSRF vulnerabilities:

### Manual Testing for IDORs (Insecure Direct Object References)

1.  **Inspect URL parameters**: Look for parameters in the URL that reference object IDs, such as `user_id`, `order_id`, or `file_id`. Change the values of these parameters to see if you can access other users' data or perform unauthorized actions.

2.  **Test hidden form fields**: Some applications use hidden form fields to store object IDs. Inspect the HTML source code of the form to identify these hidden fields and modify their values to test for IDOR vulnerabilities.

3.  **Analyze API endpoints**: If the application uses APIs, inspect the API endpoints and their parameters for potential IDOR vulnerabilities. Change the values of object IDs in the API requests to see if you can access unauthorized data.

### Manual Testing for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

1.  **Inspect input fields**: Test all input fields in the application by inserting various XSS payloads. Use the [OWASP XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet](https://owasp.org/www-community/xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet) as a reference for crafting XSS payloads.

2.  **Test URL parameters**: Some applications reflect URL parameters in the HTML output. Insert XSS payloads into the URL parameters to see if they are executed by the browser.

3.  **Test user-generated content**: Applications that allow users to post content, like comments or forum posts, might be vulnerable to stored XSS. Insert XSS payloads into the user-generated content and see if they are executed by the browser when the content is displayed.

### Manual Testing for CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

1.  **Analyze form submissions**: Inspect the HTML source code of forms to identify any CSRF tokens or anti-CSRF measures. Create a separate HTML page that submits a form to the target application without the CSRF token to test if the application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

2.  **Test AJAX requests**: Some applications use AJAX requests that may not implement CSRF protection. Inspect the JavaScript code responsible for making AJAX requests and try to forge requests without CSRF tokens to test for vulnerabilities.

3.  **Test RESTful APIs**: If the application uses RESTful APIs, analyze the API requests for CSRF protection mechanisms. Create a separate HTML page or use a tool like Postman to send requests without CSRF tokens and see if the application is vulnerable.

By following these manual testing methods, you can learn as you go along discovering IDOR, XSS, and CSRF bugs in web applications. Although manual testing is time-consuming, it helps you gain a deeper understanding of the application's functionality and potential vulnerabilities.
